abstract = {Objective: An outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China has spread quickly nationwide. Here, we report results of a descriptive, exploratory analysis of all cases diagnosed as of February 11, 2020. Methods: All COVID-19 cases reported through February 11, 2020 were extracted from China's Infectious Disease Information System. Analyses included: 1) summary of patient characteristics; 2) examination of age distributions and sex ratios; 3) calculation of case fatality and mortality rates; 4) geo-temporal analysis of viral spread; 5) epidemiological curve construction; and 6) subgroup analysis. Results: A total of 72 314 patient records-44 672 (61.8{\%}) confirmed cases, 16 186 (22.4{\%}) suspected cases, 10567 (14.6{\%}) clinical diagnosed cases (Hubei only), and 889 asymptomatic cases (1.2{\%})-contributed data for the analysis. Among confirmed cases, most were aged 30-79 years (86.6{\%}), diagnosed in Hubei (74.7{\%}), and considered mild (80.9{\%}). A total of 1 023 deaths occurred among confirmed cases for an overall case-fatality rate of 2.3{\%}. The COVID-19 spread outward from Hubei sometime after December 2019 and by February 11, 2020, 1 386 counties across all 31 provinces were affected. The epidemic curve of onset of symptoms peaked in January 23-26, then began to decline leading up to February 11. A total of 1 716 health workers have become infected and 5 have died (0.3{\%}). Conclusions: The COVID-19 epidemic has spread very quickly. It only took 30 days to expand from Hubei to the rest of Mainland China. With many people returning from a long holiday, China needs to prepare for the possible rebound of the epidemic. 目的： 新型冠状病毒肺炎在武汉暴发流行以来，已在全国范围内蔓延。对截至2020年2月11日中国内地报告所有病例的流行病学特征进行描述和分析。 方法： 选取截至2020年2月11日中国内地传染病报告信息系统中上报所有新型冠状病毒肺炎病例。分析包括：①患者特征； ②病死率；③年龄分布和性别比例；④疾病传播的时空特点； ⑤所有病例、湖北省以外病例和医务人员病例的流行病学曲线。 结果： 中国内地共报告72 314例病例，其中确诊病例44 672例（61.8{\%}），疑似病例16 186例(22.4{\%})，临床诊断病例10 567例（14.6{\%}），无症状感染者889例（1.2{\%}）。在确诊病例中，大多数年龄在30～79岁(86.6{\%})，湖北省(74.7{\%})，轻症病例为主(80.9{\%})。确诊病例中，死亡1 023例，粗病死率为2.3{\%}。个案调查结果提示，疫情在2019年12月从湖北向外传播，截至2020年2月11日，全国31个省的1 386个县区受到了影响。流行曲线显示在1月23－26日左右达到峰值，并且观察到发病数下降趋势。截至2月11日，共有1 716名医务工作者感染，其中5人死亡，粗病死率为0.3{\%}。 结论： 新型冠状病毒肺炎传播流行迅速，从首次报告病例日后30 d蔓延至31个省(区/市)，疫情在1月24－26日达到首个流行峰，2月1日出现单日发病异常高值，而后逐渐下降。随着人们返回工作岗位，需积极应对可能出现的疫情反弹。.},

abstract = {Background: Mathematical modelling of infectious diseases transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route (e.g., pandemic influenza) is increasingly being used to determine the impact of possible interventions. Although mixing patterns are known to be crucial determinants for model outcome, researchers often rely on a priori contact assumptions with little or no empirical basis. We conducted a population-based prospective survey of mixing patterns in eight European countries using a common paper-diary methodology. Methods and Findings: 7,290 participants recorded characteristics of 97,904 contacts with different individuals during one day, including age, sex, location, duration, frequency, and occurrence of physical contact. We found that mixing patterns and contact characteristics were remarkably similar across different European countries. Contact patterns were highly assortative with age: schoolchildren and young adults in particular tended to mix with people of the same age. Contacts lasting at least one hour or occurring on a daily basis mostly involved physical contact, while short duration and infrequent contacts tended to be nonphysical. Contacts at home, school, or leisure were more likely to be physical than contacts at the workplace or while travelling. Preliminary modelling indicates that 5- to 19-year-olds are expected to suffer the highest incidence during the initial epidemic phase of an emerging infection transmitted through social contacts measured here when the population is completely susceptible. Conclusions: To our knowledge, our study provides the first large-scale quantitative approach to contact patterns relevant for infections transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route, and the results should lead to improved parameterisation of mathematical models used to design control strategies. {\textcopyright} 2008 Mossong et al.},

abstract = {Strict interventions were successful to control the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in China. As transmission intensifies in other countries, the interplay between age, contact patterns, social distancing, susceptibility to infection and disease, and COVID-19 dynamics remains unclear. To answer these questions, we analyze contact surveys data for Wuhan and Shanghai before and during the outbreak and contact tracing information from Hunan Province. Daily contacts were reduced 7-9 fold during the COVID-19 social distancing period, with most interactions restricted to the household. Children 0-14 years were 59{\%} (95{\%} CI 7-82{\%}) less susceptible than individuals 65 years and over. A transmission model calibrated against these data indicates that social distancing alone, as implemented in China during the outbreak, is sufficient to control COVID-19. While proactive school closures cannot interrupt transmission on their own, they reduce peak incidence by half and delay the epidemic. These findings can help guide global intervention policies.

abstract = {Background: Researchers increasingly use social contact data to inform models for infectious disease spread with the aim of guiding effective policies about disease prevention and control. In this article, we undertake a systematic review of the study design, statistical analyses, and outcomes of the many social contact surveys that have been published. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed and Web of Science for articles regarding social contact surveys. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines as closely as possible. Results: In total, we identified 64 social contact surveys, with more than 80{\%} of the surveys conducted in high-income countries. Study settings included general population (58{\%}), schools or universities (37{\%}), and health care/conference/research institutes (5{\%}). The largest number of studies did not focus on a specific age group (38{\%}), whereas others focused on adults (32{\%}) or children (19{\%}). Retrospective (45{\%}) and prospective (41{\%}) designs were used most often with 6{\%} using both for comparison purposes. The definition of a contact varied among surveys, e.g., a nonphysical contact may require conversation, close proximity, or both. We identified age, time schedule (e.g., weekday/weekend), and household size as relevant determinants of contact patterns across a large number of studies. Conclusions: We found that the overall features of the contact patterns were remarkably robust across several countries, and irrespective of the study details. By considering the most common approach in each aspect of design (e.g., sampling schemes, data collection, definition of contact), we could identify recommendations for future contact data surveys that may be used to facilitate comparison between studies.},

abstract = {Abstract Background Rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan prompted heightened surveillance in Shenzhen and elsewhere in China. The resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control. Methods The Shenzhen CDC identified 391 SARS-CoV-2 cases from January 14 to February 12, 2020 and 1286 close contacts. We compare cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimate the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and hospitalization. We estimate metrics of disease transmission and analyze factors influencing transmission risk. Findings Cases were older than the general population (mean age 45) and balanced between males (187) and females (204). Ninety-one percent had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment. Three have died, 225 have recovered (median time to recovery is 32 days). Cases were isolated on average 4.6 days after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1.9 days. Household contacts and those travelling with a case where at higher risk of infection (ORs 6 and 7) than other close contacts. The household secondary attack rate was 15{\%}, and children were as likely to be infected as adults. The observed reproductive number was 0.4, with a mean serial interval of 6.3 days. Interpretation Our data on cases as well as their infected and uninfected close contacts provide key insights into SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology. This work shows that heightened surveillance and isolation, particularly contact tracing, reduces the time cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing R. Its overall impact, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases. We further show that children are at similar risk of infection as the general population, though less likely to have severe symptoms; hence should be considered in analyses of transmission and control.
